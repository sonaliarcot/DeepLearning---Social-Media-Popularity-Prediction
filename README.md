# Social-Media-Popularity-Prediction

The Social Media Popularity Prediction task focuses on predicting the impact of sharing different posts for a publisher on social media. Given a photo (a.k.a. post) from a publisher, the goal is to automatically predict the popularity of the photo, e.g., view count for Flickr, Pin count for Pinterest, etc.
